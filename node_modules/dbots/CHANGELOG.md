- DiscordBotlistEU (#318, #319)
- DiscordLabs: support votes endpoint (#334)
- BotsForDiscord -> DiscordsCom: support `hasVoted12h` endpoint (#334)

### Fixed:

## [9.0.1] - 2021-08-04

### Fixed:

## [9.0.0] - 2021-04-08

### Global breaking changes:

- `serviceClasses`: the `serviceClasses` property will no longer be exported as a member of the module. You can still get a record with every list using `Service.getAll()`. (#203)
- We're dropping support for internal class names: that means that from now on, we could change the service class names without marking it as a breaking change. In order to avoid issues with your code, please use the `Service.get()` method to get service classes, instead of importing them directly. This version already contains some changes to class names, so make sure that you're importing them in the supported way. (#203)
- Removed services: Arcane, BotsDataBase, DiscordAppsDev, DiscordBotsDirectory, ListMyBots, ParadiseBots (#204).
  These lists have been removed because they've been shut down.

More list-specific breaking changes are listed below

### Fixed:

- **[BREAKING]** InfinityBots: update list name, aliases and URL (#199)
- The package file now has a proper typings field
- Clients: the fillers now calculate the user count using each guild's member count, instead of relying on the user cache size (ref #182)
- Clients: improved consistency in getters' return types
- DiscordJS: fixed the way that the filler gets the shard ID for discord.js@v12 (#184)
- BotListSpace: update list name and URL (#202)

### Added:

We know the list of changes is huge, so here's the gist of it:

- If you only posted stats using the `Poster` class then nothing should change for you
- If you used one of the service classes, make sure that the property names you're accessing haven't changed (they shouldn't though)
- If you imported from any of the internal files of the package, make sure to check the list below for changes
- You can now use accurate TypeScript typings with this package

You can also refer to issue #71.

### Potentially breaking changes:

- `*` - The whole package is now written in TypeScript. The scripts have changed too.
- `*` - JSDoc annotation no longer have types, everything that can be moved to TS should no longer be written in JSDoc
  - `@private` tags can still be used when we want to mark something as "private" for the docs website, but it's not an actual private property
- `*` - In the whole package, internal `module.exports =` exports have been replaced by `default` exports
- `*` - In the whole package, functions and methods no longer return `null` when only `undefined` is documented; if they can return `null` it will be explicitly documented
- `*` - In the whole package, it's preferred to create a dedicated type/interface to document function argument, instead of using an "inline type"
- `index` - Each service class now has to be accessed via the `dbots.serviceClasses` constant, instead of directly from `dbots` (e.g. `dbots.Arcane` now becomes `dbots.serviceClasses.Arcane`)
- `index` - two functions have been renamed to camelCase (`formatRequest` and `ensurePromise`)
- `Utils/Constants` - In `PostRequestData`, multiple properties are now optional
- `Utils/Constants` - The supported `Poster` events have been renamed
- `Utils/DbotsError` - The exported `Error`, `TypeError`, and `RangeError` classes are now grouped under the `errors` exported constant (e.g. `dbotserror.Error` is now `dbotserror.errors.Error`)
- `Utils/FormatRequest` - In `RequestForm`, multiple properties are now optional
- `Utils/FormatRequest` - `FormatRequest` no longer supports aliases for some options; the correct option name is enforced by the type of the argument
- `Utils/Util` - added the `AnyObject` type and the `assert` function
- `Interface/ServiceBase` - The `ServiceBase.name` static property is now called `ServiceBase.serviceName`, in order to avoid conflicts with the `Function.name` property
- `Interface/Lists/*` - They all extend `ServiceBase`, and so they all have the change above
- `Interface/ClientFiller` - circular imports have been removed, the static class method is now a separate function
- `Interface/ClientFiller` - the new function to get client fillers does not support library aliases; the argument now uses the `Library` type
- `Service` has been renamed to `ServiceKey`
- `ServiceBase` has been renamed to `Service`
