QuaBot uses slash commands, so the prefix to use it is \`/\`! We use interactions all throughout our commands and modules.
        
            QuaBot was designed and developed by [Joa_sss](https://github.com/Joasss) and his team and was written in Typescript with the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) framework.
        
            It's very easy to get started with QuaBot, by simply typing a \`/\`! If you're still stuck somewhere, you can join our **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/HYGA7Y6ptk)** and ask for help there. To view all commands use \`/help\`. Go to the next page for more information.
